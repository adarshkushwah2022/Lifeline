## Lifeline 
The application aims to provide medical facility to the patients in various emergency conditions such as urgent need of blood, plasma, oxygen cylinders.
A notification is sent to the nearby users for helping the patient when in need. 

## Features proposed and Implemented
• The user needs to enter his/her information in the application with his location and this data gets stored in the app’s database. \
• If there is an emergency condition in which a patient needs help like blood, plasma, oxygen cylinder, etc then the notification is sent to the nearby users (in the nearby radius) on their mobile phones so that they can reach out for help. \
• Multiple users can reach out for help, so as soon as the patient gets a confirmation from any of the users for the help then  the other users are notified that the patient has got the help so that multiple users may not reach out for help. \
• As soon as the patient registers for help, the location of that patient is sent to the user going to help that patient. And the helper will be directed to the google maps to reach that location of the patient.
